<h1 id="1">How to Enable Insights in a Sticky Note</h1>

* Step 1: First [open](https://qhtutorials.github.io/posts/how-to-open-notes-list/) the Notes List. Go to the upper right and click the "Settings" or gear button. <div class="stepimage">![A screenshot of the cursor clicking the gear button on the Notes List.](blognoteslistgearsettingsedit.png "Click the gear button")</div>
* Step 2: In the Settings window that opens, click under the "Enable Insights" section to toggle this option on. <div class="stepimage">![A screenshot of the cursor clicking the toggle switch on under the "Enable Insights" section of the Settings window.](blogenableinsightsonedit.png "Switch 'Enable Insights' on")</div>
* Step 3: [Open](https://qhtutorials.github.io/posts/how-to-open-a-sticky-note/) a sticky note and type the URL of any website. The Sticky Notes app recognizes the URL and displays an "Open Link" button. Click this button to open the URL in a browser. <div class="stepimage">![A screenshot of a sticky note with a URL of "https://qhtutorials.github.io".](blogclickgithubio1.png "Type a URL in the sticky note")</div> 
* The browser displays the website. <div class="stepimage">![A screenshot of a sticky note with a URL of "https://qhtutorials.github.io".](blogclickgithubio2.png "Type a URL in the sticky note")</div> 
* Note: In Windows 10, Enable Insights recognized dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses typed into a sticky note. Cortana facilitated additional functions such as creating reminders or opening maps (Thurott, 2016). However, as of Fall 2023, Cortana was deprecated as a standalone app (*End of Support For Cortana*, n.d.), and thus Enable Insights only recognizes web addresses as of this writing.

* Step 1: [Open](https://qhtutorials.github.io/posts/how-to-open-notes-list/) the Notes List. Go to the upper right and click the "Settings" or gear button. <div class="stepimage">![A screenshot of the cursor clicking the gear button on the Notes List.](blognoteslistgearsettingsedit.png "Click the gear button")</div>
* Step 2: In the Settings window that opens, click under the "Confirm before deleting" section to toggle this option off.

<h1 id="3">How to Turn "Confirm Before Deleting" Off With Click</h1>

* Step 1: First [edit](https://qhtutorials.github.io/posts/how-to-edit-a-sticky-note/) and [delete](https://qhtutorials.github.io/posts/how-to-delete-sticky-notes/) a sticky note. In the deletion confirmation message that appears, click "Don't ask me again" and "Delete". Now after deleting sticky notes, the deletion confirmation message does not appear. <div class="stepimage">![Two screenshots where the cursor clicks the "Don't ask me again" and "Delete" buttons in the deletion confirmation window, and the resulting empty Notes List that appears as the sticky note is deleted.](blogpptdontaskmeagain.png "Click the 'Don't ask me again' and 'Delete' ")</div>
